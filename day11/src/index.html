            <h1>Is Junk Foods Good For Health?</h1>
            <h6>By: John Doe</h6>

            <p>Junk food is a pejorative term, dating back at least to the 1950s, describing food that is high in calories from sugar or fat, with little dietary fiber, protein, vitamins or minerals. It can also refer to high protein food like meat prepared with saturated fat. The term often implies that an individual of lower socioeconomic status eats unhealthy foods while someone of higher socioeconomic status eats healthy foods. However, people of all economic classes can and do eat junk food. Fast food and junk food are often used interchangeably. The term "junk food" was popularized by Michael Jacobson, director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, in 1972.</p>

            <p>Fast food is a type of mass-produced food designed for commercial resale and with a strong priority placed on "speed of service" versus other relevant factors involved in culinary science. Fast food was originally created as a commercial strategy to accommodate the larger numbers of busy commuters, travelers and wage workers who often did not have the time to sit down at a public house or diner and wait for their meal. By making speed of service the priority, this ensured that customers with strictly limited time (a commuter stopping to procure dinner to bring home to their family, for example, or an hourly laborer on a short lunch break) were not inconvenienced by waiting for their food to be cooked on-the-spot (as is expected from a traditional "sit down" restaurant). For those with no time to spare, fast food became a multibillion-dollar industry.</p>

            <p>All the junk foods are unhealthy and contain very little nutritional value. It is a fact that junk foods are designed to make you addicted to them. They are also very low in satiation value - which means that they don't fill you up. This means that you will be hungry again after a short period of time, which will lead to eating more junk food and putting on more weight. This creates a vicious cycle. Also, the high levels of sugar in junk food puts your metabolism under stress; when you eat refined sugar, your pancreas secretes high amounts of insulin to prevent a dangerous spike in blood sugar levels. Because fast food and junk food don't contain adequate amounts of protein and good carbohydrates, your blood sugar levels will drop suddenly after eating, leaving you feeling grumpy, fatigued and craving sugar.</p>
